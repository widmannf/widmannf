## Hi, I'm Felix, an astrophysicist currently looking for new challenges!

ðŸ”­ I am working as an astrophysicist at [MPE](https://mpe.mpg.de) in Munich, Germany, where I have done my PhD followed by a PostDoc position. I have worked on data analysis of observational and instrumental data. I was part of many instrumentation projects, mostly on the optical interferometer [GRAVITY](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/gravity/) that is observing black holes from the VLTI observatory in Chile.

ðŸŒ± I am looking for a career change and developing new skills.

ðŸ’¬ [Get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-widmann-ab045b141/)

Some of my coding projects here include:

- [GravityPy](https://github.com/widmannf/GravityPy): Python package to analyze and fit data from the optical interferometer GRAVITY. All data from the Galactic Center Project at MPE was analyzed with this package.

- [VLTIpol](https://github.com/widmannf/VLTIpol): Calibration package to correct observations from the VLTI observatory and the GRAVITY instrument for instrumental polarization. The work leading into this code can be found in the accompanying [publication in A&A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03472).

- [GRAVITY-Phasemaps](https://github.com/widmannf/VLTIpol): Application of the correction for optical aberrations in GRAVITY, following our [publication in A&A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12098).

- [P-Rex](https://github.com/widmannf/prex): A project from back in the days of my Masters Thesis, where I tested if atmospheric measurements can be used in a novel way to improve interferometry, [published in MNRAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07716).
